# Prototype Job Listing Page Design for NodeJS
### A sample front-end page with login and registration using NodeJS, Express, Passport, Mongoose and MongoDB

## Introduction

The task is to use the current HTML template and develop a NodeJS app together with the use of Express, Passport, Mongoose and MongoDB. The site will be hosted in Heroku and the database will be hosted in mLab. This is just a trial on how to make the application working. 

## Live Site Example

[Heroku App](https://prototype-design3.herokuapp.com)


## Tools/Kits Used

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - open-source cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - open-source cross-platform document-oriented program
* [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/) - authentication middleware for Node.js 
* [MongooseJS](http://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modelling for Node.js 
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - free source code editor that supports several languages
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - version control using git
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - desktop client of GitHub to easily manage code locally
* [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) - open source GUI compiler for pre-processing languages (Less,Sass,etc.)
* [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app) - web-based icon management tool (used in combining SVG files)
* [Material Design for Bootstrap 4](https://mdbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap Material Design UI KIT and template
* [Node.js Loginapp](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loginapp) - user login and registration app using NodeJS contributed by Brad Traversy
* [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up/) - Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - open source GUI tool

## Completed Tasks:

* Combined SVG files into a single SVG sprite
* SVG sprite used for all icon assets
* Downloaded and customized Material Design Bootstrap 4 template to save time
* Customized MDB template and compiled using SASS/SCSS
* Design adjustments of HTML, CSS & JS code as required and part of testing/debugging
* Installed and configured NodeJS, MongoDB, PassportJS, MongooseJS and other dependencies
* Modified and integrated customized  HTML MDBootstrap template and Node.js Login App
* Published new project/repository to GitHub for preparation to Heroku app
* Created Heroku account, downloaded Heroku CLI, set up and deployed the Heroku app
* Created mLab account to enable MongoDB cloud integration with Heroku
* Fixed login and registration app connectivity to the database


## Instructions:

* Go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/rcap15/prototype-design3)
* Click "Clone or download" dropdown button to see the options
* You can either use Git or checkout with SVN using the web url, Open in Desktop (GithHub Desktop needs to be installed) or Download ZIP
* The quickest way is to download the zip file as we currently don't need a site and database configuration
* Extract the zip file to your desktop and open the folder to view the files
* Install NodeJS, MongoDB, etc. (installation resources available online)
* Using MongoDB guide, create a database called "prototype-design3" and a sample collection "db.createCollection('users');"
* Assuming you have installed all the tools locally, you can run your app from the project directory
* In my case I am using Git Bash, run command "node app" and hit enter it should display started on default port 3000
* Open your browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/" to check if the page is working fine
* You can click "Login" at the bottom of the page or go directly to "http://localhost:3000/users/login" to test DB connectivity
